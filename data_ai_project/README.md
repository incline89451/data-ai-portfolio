# AI Governance & Data Engineering Portfolio

## Overview

This portfolio is to show the importance of **end-to-end Data & AI systems** with a strong emphasis on **governance, trust, and business value**.  
It is structured into **five phases**, each building on the previous one — starting from SQL exploration and progressing toward advanced AI governance.  

The work is based primarily on the **Lahman Baseball Database** (historical player, team, and salary data) and extended with synthetic/alternative datasets where needed.  
While the examples use sports data, the principles apply to **healthcare, finance, and other regulated industries** where trust and compliance are critical. 

The data set is small and all data is publicly available.

## Purpose

The goal of this roadmap is to:

* Show why **data foundations, governance, and trust** are critical to AI success.
* Demonstrate how **security, observability, and lineage** protect both organizations and customers.
* Highlight the **intersection of MLOps, LLMOps, and compliance** in delivering responsible AI.
* Provide a **public-friendly learning path** that mirrors **enterprise-grade workflows**.

## What This Roadmap Proves

1. **Data Foundations Matter** – Clean, queryable, and governed data (SQL, catalogs, metadata) is the base for any AI initiative.
2. **Lineage & Observability** – You can’t trust AI outputs if you can’t trace where the data came from or monitor model behavior.
3. **Security & Privacy by Design** – Protect sensitive data (de-identification, IAM, encryption) while keeping it useful.
4. **MLOps & LLMOps Discipline** – Training is not enough; you must deploy, monitor, and continuously check for drift, bias, and compliance.
5. **Trust as a Product Feature** – Governance isn’t “red tape.” When done right, it accelerates adoption, builds customer confidence, and creates competitive advantage.
6. **Enterprise + Public Perspective** – Demonstrating primarily **AWS-native workflows** (Athena, Glue, SageMaker, Lake Formation, IAM) while also including **open alternatives** (Colab, JupyterLab, GitHub, lightweight libraries) shows versatility — prototyping fast while respecting enterprise rigor.

## Who This Is For

* **Product Leaders** – See how governance can become a competitive advantage.
* **Engineering Teams** – Explore AWS-first examples with Python and practical alternatives.
* **Compliance & Risk Professionals** – Understand how trust frameworks map to real-world AI projects.
* **Anyone Learning AI** – Follow along to see why responsible AI starts long before a model is trained.

  - Explainability (SHAP/LIME) + bias analysis.  
- **Skills:** ML modeling, feature engineering, interpretability, fairness.  

---

### **Phase 4: LLM / RAG Systems**
- **Goal:** Build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and monitor LLMs in production.  
- **Projects:**  
  - RAG chatbot with source attribution (baseball rules/FAQs).  
  - LLM observability dashboard for query accuracy, latency, hallucinations.  
- **Skills:** LLM integration, RAG pipelines, observability, trust in AI.  

---

### **Phase 5: AI Governance & Compliance**
- **Goal:** Demonstrate risk mitigation and operational governance in AI.  
- **Projects:**  
  - Model drift detection & alerts.  
  - AI governance playbook (incident response aligned with HIPAA/GDPR principles).  
- **Skills:** Governance, compliance, operational readiness, responsible AI.  

---

## Technologies Used

- **Languages & Tools:** Python, SQL, Pandas, scikit-learn, SHAP/LIME, Streamlit, Plotly  
- **Databases:** Postgres, AWS Athena  
- **Data Engineering:** AWS Glue, Parquet, SQLAlchemy, logging  
- **LLM & RAG:** OpenAI API, LangChain, FAISS/Chroma for retrieval

---

## Portfolio Strategic Goals
 
- **Bridge product and engineering**: translating business problems into technical solutions.  
- **Design for trust and compliance**: embedding privacy, fairness, and observability into AI systems.  
- **Think strategically**: building reusable frameworks and playbooks for organizations adopting AI.  
- **Communicate clearly**: through READMEs, blog posts, and visualizations that make complex work accessible.
